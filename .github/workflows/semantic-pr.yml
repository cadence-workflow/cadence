            Hey there and thank you for opening this pull request! 👋🏼

            We require pull request titles to follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and it looks like your proposed title needs to be adjusted.

            **Examples:**
              - \`feat: add user authentication system\`
              - \`fix: resolve memory leak in worker pool\`
              - \`docs: update API documentation\`
              - \`test: add integration tests for auth flow\`

            This is currently a **warning only** and won't block your PR from being merged.

            Details:

            ```
            ${{ steps.lint_pr_title.outputs.error_message }}
            ```
