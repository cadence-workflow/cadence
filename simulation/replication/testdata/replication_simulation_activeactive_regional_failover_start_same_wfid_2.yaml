# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive_regional_failover_start_same_wfid_2
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive_regional_failover_start_same_wfid_2.yml
# This test is a variant of the activeactive_regional_failover_start_same_wfid test
# It tests that when a workflow is already running in one cluster the same workflow cannot be started in another cluster
# even after failover
