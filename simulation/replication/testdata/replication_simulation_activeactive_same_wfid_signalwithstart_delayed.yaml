# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive_same_wfid_signalwithstart_delayed
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive_same_wfid_signalwithstart_delayed.yml
# When a domain is configured as active-active
# And the same workflow ID is used to SignalWithStart in multiple clusters with a 20s delay
# Then there should be no duplicate run - a single workflow should contain both signals
