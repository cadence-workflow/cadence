            ## ⚠️ No Linked Issue Found

            This PR does not appear to have a linked issue in its description.

            ### Why link issues?
            Linking issues helps maintain traceability between PRs and the problems they solve, making it easier to:
            - Understand the context and motivation for changes
            - Track feature development and bug fixes
            - Generate accurate release notes

            ### How to link an issue
            Add one of these keywords followed by an issue number to your PR description:
            - `Closes #123` - for features and enhancements
            - `Fixes #123` - for bug fixes
            - `Resolves #123` - general purpose

            You can also use: `close`, `closed`, `fix`, `fixed`, `resolve`, `resolved`

            **Example:**
            ```
            This PR adds support for new authentication methods.

            Closes #456
            ```

            ### For minor changes
            If this is a truly minor change (typo fix, formatting, etc.) that doesn't warrant an issue, you can skip this check by using a conventional commit prefix in your PR title:
            - `docs: fix typo in README`
            - `chore: update dependencies`
            - `ci: update workflow`
            - `style: format code`

            ---

            **Note:** This check is currently set to warning-only and won't block merging. However, linking issues is strongly encouraged for all substantive changes.
