//
// Name them more by their intent than their exact ranges, because the ranges will be adjusted to
// add a small bit of safety buffer and round to a nicely-divisible count.

// you should probably make a new bucket instead so you have more of an unexpected-value safety buffer.

// that all histograms start with a 0 value (else erroneous negative values are impossible to notice),
// and avoids some bugs with low values (tally.MustMakeExponentialDurationBuckets misbehaves for small numbers,

// The buckets produced may be padded further to reach a "full" power-of-2 row, as this simplifies math elsewhere
