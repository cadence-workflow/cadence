Cadence Worker
==============

Cadence Worker is a new role for Cadence service used for hosting any
components responsible for performing background processing on the Cadence
cluster.

Replicator
----------

Replicator is a background worker responsible for consuming replication tasks
generated by remote Cadence clusters and pass it down to processor so they
can be applied to local Cadence cluster.

Quickstart for localhost development of XDC
====================================

1. Start Cadence development server for cluster_0, cluster_1 and cluster_2:
```
./cadence-server --zone xdc_cluster_0 start
./cadence-server --zone xdc_cluster_1 start
./cadence-server --zone xdc_cluster_2 start
```

2. Create global domains
```
cadence --do sample domain register --ac cluster_0 --cl cluster_0 cluster_1 cluster_2
```

6. Failover between zones:

Failover to cluster_1:
```
cadence --do sample domain update --ac cluster_1
```
Failback to cluster_2:
```
cadence --do sample domain update --ac cluster_0
```

Archiver
--------

Archiver is used to handle archival of workflow execution histories. It does this by hosting a cadence client worker
and running an archival system workflow. The archival client gets used to initiate archival through signal sending. The archiver
shards work across several workflows.
