# 🎉 Cadence Golang Hello World - COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!

---

## 📋 Tutorial Steps Completed

### ✅ Step 1: Implement A Cadence Worker Service
- [x] Initialized Go module: `github.com/uber/cadence/samples/hello-world`
- [x] Created `main.go` with worker service layout
- [x] Implemented logger configuration
- [x] Set up Cadence client with YARPC and gRPC transport
- [x] Created worker initialization code

### ✅ Step 2: Write Activity and Workflow
- [x] Implemented `helloWorldActivity` - returns greeting message
- [x] Implemented `helloWorldWorkflow` - orchestrates activity execution
- [x] Configured activity options (timeouts, heartbeat)
- [x] Registered workflow and activity with worker
- [x] Added proper error handling and logging

### ✅ Step 3: Run the Workflow with Cadence CLI
- [x] Started Cadence server via Docker Compose
- [x] Verified domain registration (`test-domain`)
- [x] Built and started the worker service
- [x] Executed workflows via Cadence CLI
- [x] Verified successful workflow completions

### ✅ Step 4: Monitor Cadence Workflow (Optional)
- [x] Verified Web UI is accessible at http://localhost:8088
- [x] Confirmed workflow history is visible
- [x] Reviewed execution details and event flow

## 🔧 Technology Stack

- **Go Version**: 1.25.2
- **Cadence Client**: v1.3.0
- **YARPC**: v1.80.0
- **Transport**: gRPC
- **Logger**: zap (Uber's structured logging)
- **Metrics**: tally (Uber's metrics library)

## 🎓 Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. **Workflow**
A durable function that orchestrates activities:
- Runs for the entire lifecycle
- Can be long-running (days, weeks, months)
- Automatically retried on failures
- Maintains state across restarts

### 2. **Activity**
A function that does actual work:
- Can interact with external services
- Can be retried independently
- Timeout and heartbeat configurations
- Executes business logic

### 3. **Worker**
A service that polls for and executes tasks:
- Registers workflows and activities
- Polls task lists for work
- Executes workflow and activity code
- Reports results back to Cadence server

### 4. **Domain**
A logical namespace for workflows:
- Isolates workflows between projects
- Has its own configuration
- Controls data retention

### 5. **Task List**
A queue of tasks for workers:
- Workers poll specific task lists
- Routes work to appropriate workers
- Enables load balancing

---

## 🌟 What Makes This Special

### Durability
- Workflow state is persisted automatically
- Survives worker crashes and restarts
- No manual state management needed

### Reliability
- Automatic retries on failures
- Configurable timeout policies
- Built-in error handling

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of workers
- Task distribution across workers
- Handles millions of workflows

### Visibility
- Complete execution history
- Real-time monitoring via Web UI
- Detailed event logs

---

## 📝 Configuration Details

```go
var HostPort = "127.0.0.1:7833"      // Cadence server address
var Domain = "test-domain"            // Workflow domain
var TaskListName = "test-worker"      // Task list identifier
var ClientName = "test-worker"        // Client name for YARPC
var CadenceService = "cadence-frontend" // Service routing key
```

### Activity Options
```go
ScheduleToStartTimeout: 1 minute   // Max time in queue
StartToCloseTimeout:    1 minute   // Max execution time
HeartbeatTimeout:       20 seconds // Heartbeat interval
```

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Start Everything
```bash
# 1. Start Cadence server
cd /Users/zawadzki/Uber/cadence
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# 2. Start worker
cd /Users/zawadzki/Uber/cadence/samples/hello-world
GOWORK=off ./hello-world

# 3. Execute workflow (in another terminal)
docker run --network=host --rm ubercadence/cli:master \
  --domain test-domain workflow start \
  --et 60 --tl test-worker \
  --workflow_type main.helloWorldWorkflow \
  --input '"YourName"'
```

### Monitor
- **Logs**: `tail -f /Users/zawadzki/Uber/cadence/samples/hello-world/worker.log`
- **Web UI**: http://localhost:8088 (domain: `test-domain`)
- **CLI**: `docker run --network=host --rm ubercadence/cli:master --domain test-domain workflow list`
