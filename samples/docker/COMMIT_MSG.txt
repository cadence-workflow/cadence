feat: Add Docker support for Cadence samples

Why:
- Current samples only support local machine setup
- Need to support Kubernetes deployment scenarios
- Simplify onboarding process for new users

This change:
- Adds Dockerfile for sample applications
- Adds docker-compose.yml for local development
- Adds documentation for Docker usage

Testing:
- Built and tested Docker image locally
- Verified sample workflows run in containerized environment
- Tested with docker-compose setup

What's Next:
- Add Kubernetes Helm charts
- Set up CI/CD pipeline for Docker images
- Add more sample workflows
