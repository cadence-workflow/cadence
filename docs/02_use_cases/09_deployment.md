# Deployment

Deployment of applications to containers or virtual or physical machines is a non trivial process. 
Its business logic has to deal with complex requirements around rolling upgrades, canary deployments and rollbacks.
Cadence is a perfect platform for building a deployment solution as it provides all the necessary guarantees and abstractions 
allowing developers focusing on the business logic.
