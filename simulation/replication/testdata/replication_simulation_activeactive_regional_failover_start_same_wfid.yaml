# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive_regional_failover_start_same_wfid
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive_regional_failover_start_same_wfid.yml
# When a domain is configured as active-active
# And a workflow is running in one cluster
# And a failover occurs
# It should not be possible to start another workflow with the same workflowID
# And the request should be rejected with error "Workflow execution is already running"
