# This file is a replication simulation scenario spec.
# It is parsed into ReplicationSimulationConfig struct.
# Replication simulation for this file can be run via ./simulation/replication/run.sh --scenario activeactive_same_wfid
# Dynamic config overrides can be set via config/dynamicconfig/replication_simulation_activeactive_same_wfid.yml
# Tests that the same wfid cannot be created in multiple clusters in active-active mode
